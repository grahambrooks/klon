== klon

klon is an experimental project to see if significant parallel
processing can help with detecting duplicates in text files.

== Clone detection

Klon uses a bucket algorithm. When scanning a text file each line is
added to a buffer until a threshold (the minimum number of lines to be
considered duplicates) is reached. At the point the hash is added to a
map along with the starting line number and the filename.

For a file of 10 lines and a duplication threshold of 6, 5 hashes are
produced as follows:

1. Hash of lines 1..6
2. Hash of lines 2..7
3. Hash of lines 3..8
4. Hash of lines 4..9
5. Hash of lines 5..10

klon is currently not expected to be a full blown application to find
text duplications. At present the goal is to establish the algorithm
required to utilise significant parallelisation in a domain where the
amount of processing is relatively modest when compared to the IO
requirements.
